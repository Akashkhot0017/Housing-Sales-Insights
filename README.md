#  Housing Sales Analysis – Power BI Project  

##  Project Overview  
This project provides an end-to-end analysis of housing sales data using Power BI.  
It uncovers insights into market trends, sales performance, and house-type analysis, helping stakeholders make informed and data-driven decisions.  

---

##  Problem Statement  
The housing market produces large volumes of sales and pricing data.  
However, raw datasets are often inconsistent, complex, and not visually intuitive, which makes it difficult to:  

- Track year-over-year (YOY) growth  
- Compare offer price vs purchase price  
- Evaluate regional & house-type performance  
- Identify factors influencing property prices  

---

##  Solution  
Using Power BI, advanced DAX measures, and interactive dashboards, the project solves these challenges by:  

- Cleaning and transforming data for structured reporting  
- Creating measures like YOY Growth, Median Sales Price Change, Total YTD, Units Sold, SQM Price  
- Designing interactive dashboards with slicers for region, sales type, and house type  
- Delivering insights through clear visual storytelling

##  Dashboards & Insights  

### 1️ House Market Overview  
- Median Sales Price Change by Region → Highlights regional differences in housing price changes.  
- Units Sold & 12-Month Sales (KPIs) → Key metrics showing sales volume and revenue trend.  
- Offer Price vs Purchase Price (Scatter Plot) → Compares listed vs. actual transaction values.  
- YOY Sales Growth by Sales Type → Shows how different sales categories (regular, family, other) are performing over time.

### 2️ Sales Performance  
- Sales by Region (Bar Chart) → Compares sales performance across regions like Zealand, Jutland, Fyn & Islands, and Bornholm.  
- Key Influencers (AI Visual) → Identifies drivers influencing purchase price (e.g., age of buyer).  
- Time-Based Sales (YTD Table) → Tracks sales progression across year, quarter, and month.  
- Offer-to-SQM Ratio by Sales Type → Evaluates how different sales categories compare in price efficiency.  
- Average SQM Price by Region (Donut Chart) → Breaks down average square meter cost distribution across regions.

### 3️ House Type Analysis  
- Average Offer vs Purchase Price by House Type → Displays differences between asking price and sale price for house types (Villa, Apartment, Townhouse, etc.).  
- Avg Inflation / Interest / Yield by House Type → Shows external factors affecting pricing.  
- Average SQM Price by House Type (Bar + Line Combo) → Provides comparative insights into housing affordability per square meter.
